# Risk Strategies Simulation

Interactive visualizations exploring risk management strategies and
their long-term implications, inspired by [Luca Dellannaâ€™s
work](https://luca-dellanna.com/posts/long-term-risks) on risk
management and long-term decision-making.

## Overview

This project provides visual simulations that demonstrate key concepts
from risk management research, including ergodicity, survival
strategies, and the importance of avoiding catastrophic losses in
long-term investment approaches.

## Visualizations

The project includes interactive simulations that demonstrate:

1.  **Monte Carlo Risk Simulations**: Comparing different risk
    strategies over thousands of scenarios
2.  **Long-term Performance Analysis**: Time series showing how
    different strategies perform over extended periods
3.  **Risk-Return Trade-offs**: Interactive exploration of the
    relationship between risk tolerance and long-term outcomes
